; Need to constrain MOD value for PRP verbs.  Also for passive participles.

;; Verbal affix for present and passive participles, which can modify N-bars
;; DPF (7-Apr-99) Removed POSTHD - since the head_complement rule now passes
;; up the value of POSTHD from the head-dtr, so we need to leave it unmarked
;; to get "managers interviewed by Abrams" on the passive-by reading, and also
;; to still get "the interviewed managers"

;; Present participles and passives are both marked as PRD +, to block e.g. 
;; "the destroyed by Sandy chair" or "the talking to Kim consultant", but then
;; to get these participles alone in attributive position, we need a 
;; generalization of the attributive-adjective lexical rule below.
;; DPF 19-Feb-01 - To avoid massive unwanted ambiguity as in "Kim is sleeping"
;; restrict the MOD value to [AUX -].  
;; DPF 24-Mar-01 - Added SUBJ..SLASH 0-dlist to avoid spurious gaps.
;; DPF 18-Aug-01 - Removed [SUBJ.OPT -] to allow participle phrases without
;; subjects to be no-copula clauses, as in "arriving tomorrow".
;; DPF 24-Sep-01 - Added [MOD..TENSE real_tense as hack to block participles
;; from modifying nocop VPs, as in "partial clearing" - works since nouns have
;; underspecified TAM.
;; DPF 18-Apr-03 - From 19-Feb-01 - This also blocks "I am available starting
;; on Monday"
;; DPF 27-Apr-03 - Note that in blocking ambiguity for "Kim is sleeping"
;; (see 19-Feb-01), we also prevent an analysis for "Kim is happy driving",
;; so probably want to remove this constraint once parse ranking can carry the
;; load, given that there are also contexts where we want "Kim is, sleeping"

; DPF 11-Nov-03 - Gave up on using past-participle form as input for passive,
; since this lack of constraint on PROGR created too much trouble for

; 'Kim is being hired'.  One disadvantage is that we have to stipulate

; let K2Y distinguish true base-VPs from participles.
; DPF 7-Nov-03 - Remember that bse_verb can't have TENSE no_tense (which would
; be convenient for generation) since it can combine with "do" as in "did the

; DPF 14-Aug-99 - Reorder appending of RELS from above since treatment of

; DPF 22-May-00 - But lexical rules in general may want to change categories,
; and the output's properties should conform to the type; for example, the
; rule for partitives wants to have the output be a noun, so the first element
; on RELS should be a nom_rel, not the quant_rel which the DTR would supply.
; So we go back to the original appending model, and leave the proper
; treatment of scope holes in fragments for later solutions.

; ERB (05-10-97) Before we had a special rule hcomp_yn_root for matrix polar
; questions.  Now, the unique head complement rule is taking over this job.
; To do this, we must put the int_m_rel onto the inverted auxiliaries (see also
; sai_synsem).  The original objection to this was that the inverted
; auxiliaries are used for things other than matrix questions (i.e., negative
; inversion).  However, a) we don't currently have an analysis of negative
; inversion, and b) it's not clear that they are the same auxiliaries.  The
; most obvious test -- 1st person aren't -- is not available since the
; contracted auxiliaries are in general disallowed in negative inverstion
; (polarity effect?).
;
; At the moment this is allowing "Will who sleep?" and "Will Kim see who?"
; (actually two parses of the latter).  This is fine, except that this is not
; producing the apropriate semantics.  In fact, all ynq (matrix and
; subordinate) are not currently specified for PARAMS.  I think this will be
; easier to fix once we have a) lexical threading and b) an implementation of
; the analysis of echo questions, so I am leaving it for later.
 
; DPF (10-Jan-99) Added SUBJ value identified with dtr's SPR value (usually
; < anti_synsem > which never unifies with real synsem), in order to allow 
; adjunct extraction to still apply to inverted sentences such as "When is 
; Kim happy" where "is Kim happy" is built by two applications of the head_comp
; rule.  By identifying SUBJ with dtr's SPR, we can maintain lexical control
; over modifiability, in particular blocking spurious modification of 
; auxiliary "do", both in noninverted and inverted clauses.
; DPF 22-Apr-00 - Added reentrancy for VFORM on DTR and mother - don't know
; why this was omitted before.  It's needed to block spurious parse for e.g. 
; "Could you sleep please"
; DPF 5-Jul-02 - Removed re-entrancy of SYNSEM..SUBJ..INDEX with dtr's, since
; it was wrecking coordination of "did Kim win or did Sandy win, since the
; SUBJ..INDEX got identified for both.  So what do we give up?
 
; ERB (2003-10-13) Making a supertype to keep mal_sai as close to sai as

; DPF 31-Jul-99 - Removed [INV -] from DTR, since it blocked entry for
; "Is that also important?"
; DPF 1-Jun-01 - Removed DTR..SUBJ canonical_synsem, since prevents relative
; clauses headed by these, as in "messages that are not valid fail".
; DPF 3-Jun-01 - Made DTR..VFORM fin rather than fin* to avoid V+ADV analysis
; of "be not happy"
; DPF 13-Sep-01 - Copy attributes of HEAD from dtr to mother, to make sure that
; dtr is [AUX +] but mother is [AUX +*] so it will still coordinate with nonaux
; ERB 2003-10-13 Make supertype to keep mal_adv_addition as close as possible.
; DPF 19-apr-05 - Block adv_addition rule from applying to negated auxiliaries,
; since these (uniquely) have ALT2KEYREL.PRED neg_rel, while the positive ones
; are unconstrained.
; DPF 25-nov-05 - Removed AUX + from mother, since it was preventing adjunct-
; extraction for e.g. "In Berlin, Browne is also Abrams"
; DPF 08-oct-06 - Note that this rule does not correctly get the scope right
; for "must not" which idiosyncratically gives the modal scope over the
; the neg_rel.  Can't simply split rule, since would have to overwrite the
; qeq in the lexical entry for "must" to insert neg_rel in scope chain.  So
; probably need to manually add separate "must not" lexical entry and block
; application of this rule to "must".  Then what about non-neg adverbs with
; "must"?  FIX someday.
;; DPF 2012-12-21 - Removed dtr's ALT2KEYREL.PRED never_unify_rel,
;; since this blocked e.g. |Kim isn't always Abrams|

;; some people talking to whom was pleasant", but we would need to distinguish
;; at least rel-pro "that" (and maybe "who") from "whom" - maybe later.
;; DPF 8-Nov-01 - The decision to block extraction from verbal gerunds means
;; we don't get "Which books are you interested in buying".
;; DPF 21-Jul-03 - Removed PT notpro from mother's index - not clear
;; why it was there, but it blocked "my arriving surprised kim".
;; DPF 23-aug-04 - Added SLASH 0-dlist, like for nominal gerunds, to further
;; enforce Ross's complex-NP constraint.
;; DPF 23-aug-04 - Regarding 02-June-99 comment, we now more generally use
;; SORT to block spurious analysis for "kim is being good", just like for
;; "Kim is arriving", so we remove the [AUX -] constraint, which means we
;; once again can get "after being hired, Kim smiled"
;; Changed SYNSEM nonpro_onearg_synsem to SYNSEM basic_one_arg so as to
;; leave the LEX value underspecified, so we can avoid bare-vger for 
;; unadorned verbal gerunds.
;; DPF 26-aug-07 - Restrict DTR..SUBJ..HEAD noun to avoid making gerunds
;; for locative inversion verbs like "going"

;; DPF (12-Jul-98) In order to allow prenominal adjectives for nominal gerunds,
;; as in "regular tasting of wine is healthy", we have to treat the specifier
;; of the gerund as obligatory, since prenominal adjectives distinguish proper
;; from common nouns based on the optionality (or absence) of the specifier.
;; So these gerunds have to undergo the bare plural rule if no determiner is
;; present, which means they also have to be DIV +.
;; DPF 26-Mar-01 - Added [ALTMIN relation] to mother, to avoid having verbal
;; gerunds as, e.g., modified by "per/a person".
;; DPF 22-Apr-01 - Removed DIV + since we're getting a systematic
;; ambiguity between bare nominal gerunds and bare verbal gerunds.  This means
;; we'll block "hiring of consultants is important", but that's okay for now.
;; DPF 30-Aug-01 - But we also lose "loud singing is discouraged", which is
;; not okay, so we put DIV + back on mother.
;; DPF 23-Sep-01 - Used to have [ALTMIN relation] to block gerunds appearing as
;; left members of noun-noun compounds, but this also blocked them as heads of
;; compounds as in "chair buying is fun".  So eliminate this constraint, and
;; allow nominal gerunds on both sides of compounds, as in "email routing list"
;; or "weekend shopping regulations" - and block pres-participles as adjectives
;; to avoid apparently spurious ambiguity for e.g. "shopping trip".  But 
;; consider "the hiring consultant" which is ambiguous between the one who
;; does the hiring and the one who advises on hiring - maybe differing 
;; intonation suggests two distinct analyses, not spurious.  But block for now.
;; DPF 10-Nov-01 - Made nominal gerunds have head type nomger so they can be
;; distinguished from non-derived nouns (e.g. so modifiers like "per" don't
;; attach).
;; DPF 26-aug-04 - Note that we leave the output of the nominal-gerund rule
;; unmarked for INFLECTD so it can appear as the left member of n-n-cmpnds.
;; DPF 13-jul-06 - Added DIV + to SPR, to avoid spurious ambiguity with
;; nbar_coord_asym_rule.

;; This is too restrictive.  It only forms nominal gerunds from strictly

;; DPF 22-Feb-01 - Added restriction on --COMPKEY (and --OCOMPKEY) to prevent

;; DPF 26-Mar-01 - Make the OPT value of the of-PP complement be same as that
;; of the verb's complement NP.
;; DPF 23-Sep-01 - But this prevents e.g. "hiring is important".  So make the
;; value OPT +, which seems true for nominal gerunds.
;; DPF 03-Apr-03 - Constrained PP-comp to be [SLASH 0-dlist] (and REL and QUE)
;; Long-standing bug.  Sigh.
;; DPF 22-Jul-03 - Added constraint COMPS <expressed_synsem> to remove spurious
;; ambiguity for "My hiring" as we do for ordinary n_ppcomp lexical entries.
;; DPF 11-oct-05 - Try preserving optionality of complement from dtr to mother.
;; DPF 4-nov-05 - But this prevents N-N compounds where the first is notionally
;; an argument of the second (from a strictly transitive verb), as in 
;; "cat chasing is popular."  So let's try another approach, where we allow
;; transitive verbs to undergo this rule as long as there is not an alternative
;; entry like a v_prep_dir_le which would compete.  The underlying idea is
;; that there should be a single lexical entry with an underspecification 
;; for prep-dir and strict-transitive, but we currently have to express this as
;; an explicit disjunction with two lexical entries.  This approach doesn't yet
;; do so well with causative/inchoative alternations, where the two verbs
;; introduce different predicates, and we can't easily get to the 
;; underspecified sense.  For now, we'll exclude the causative variant here, 
;; and expect some post-processing to do the right thing with the semantics of
;; e.g. "cat shipping" to get from the overly specific "_ship_v_1_rel" to one 
;; possible reading where there is a "_ship_v_cause_rel".
;; DPF 27-aug-07 - Re 22-Feb-01: This constraint on --OCOMPKEY is overly
;; restrictive, since it blocks gerunds for verbs with an optional second
;; complement (like "recommend").  Instead, require that the REST of the 
;; COMPS list be *olist*, and add ALTS.NGER + to still block unwanted gerunds
;; for causatives.

;; Makes "admired" into an attributive adjective, as in "the admired hero"
;; DPF 22-Feb-01 - Added restriction of 'independent_rel' on --COMPKEY (and 
;; --OCOMPKEY) to prevent verb-particle verbs (with "selected_rel" complements)
;; from undergoing rule.
;; DPF 22-May-01 - But this did not generalize to blocking other unwanted
;; subcat variants, like S-comp-taking "checking".  So instead constrain
;; dtr's SYNSEM to be passive_or_unacc_subst, and require the --COMPKEY to be
;; no_rel.  This allows only intransitive (past-participle) verbs or passive 
;; transitive verbs to undergo this rule.
;; DPF 31-Jul-01 - Removed attr_adj_synsem from output since it didn't work.
;; What was I thinking?  Also removed MOD..SPR..MIN explicit_q_rel from
;; output, since this blocks "hired consultants arrive".  What was it for?
;; DPF 23-Sep-01 - Tempting to restrict this rule to only passives, since now 
;; handling pres-participles as nominal gerunds in noun-noun compounds.  (We
;; don't yet enable unaccusative participles as in "the fallen leaf".)  But as
;; noted above, what about two readings for "the hiring consultant" - one seems
;; to be n-n compound, the other an attrib adj, so maybe need both?  Block for
;; now.
;; DPF 25-Nov-01 - Changed SYNSEM.HEAD to be verb* rather than adj*, to allow
;; "The recently purchased chair arrived"
;; DPF 3-Jan-02 - Added hack unary length limit on RELS for input, to block 
;; application of rule to v-np-pp verbs like "send" (cf. 'Do you offer a 
;; printed catalog')
;; For now, allow only intransitive and transitive verb participles to appear
;; as attributive modifiers - block e.g. subj-equi variants to avoid spurious
;; ambiguity for 'the starting point'
;; DPF 14-dec-03 - Consider removing LPERIPH na, since it prevents NPs with
;; one of these guys from appearing in appositive constructions: "the singing 
;; bear Kim".  Not clear what work it does.  FIX.
;; DPF 27-jan-04 - Changed LPERIPH on mother from na to +, to enable these
;; as modifiers in compounds, as in "Fedex tracking number".  Can't remove the
;; constraint entirely (see above) since it serves to block unwanted
;; appositive analyses for examples like "Kim interviewed Sandy".
;; DPF 21-aug-04 - Added SPEC < > to prevent these from being modified by
;; posthead PP - always a dead-end attachment.
;; DPF 10-mar-05 - Re 25-Nov-01: Now allowing adverbs to modify adjectives as
;; well, so make output be HEAD adj, which also allows us now to coordinate
;; these as in "the admired and hated politicians" (didn't parse before).
;; DPF 28-mar-05 - Restored LPERIPH bool in order to prevent these inside
;; N-Adj-N compounds, since there is an alternative analysis of e.g.
;; 'company tracking number' where 'tracking number' is an N-N compound.
;; DPF 16-sept-05 - Try blocking SPR for these, to avoid e.g. "*a very hired
;; consultant"
;; DPF 5-nov-05 - It's tempting to relax SYNSEM..MOD..MIN from nom_nbar_rel to 
;; reg_nom_rel in order to also allow "the retired Abrams", but this leads to
;; unpleasant spurious ambiguity as in "Abrams has hired Browne."  Let's try
;; a specialized variant of this rule for proper names which requires that
;; they then have a non-empty specifier.
;; DPF 13-nov-05 - Re: 16-sept-05, but this also prevents "most visited",
;; so instead constrain SPR to only allow this-that ones, which include
;; comparative/superlative deg-specs.
;; DPF 13-may-06 - Re: 3-Jan-02 - this constraint no longer blocks application
;; to v-np-pp verbs since lexical semantics is no longer complex, and it
;; blocks desired application to lexical passives like "untrafficked", which
;; do have decomposed semantics.  So remove it.

;; The partitive construction rule introduces a new type of relation: 
;; part_of_rel, which contains the semantic information of the partitive.
;; The features of the relation, a subtype of nom_rel, were
;; - LBL, 
;; - ARG0, the index of the NP,
;; - SET, the handle of the PP complement, defining the set of which the head 
;;        determines a subset,
;; - NPREP,the index of the PP complement of the head, which is actually the
;;        index of the NP complement of that PP.
;; The idea is that there is a difference between, for example, "some books", 
;; and "some of the books". In the first case, "books" can refer to a subset
;; of the set of all the existing books, and "some" quantifies over the 
;; set of all existing books. In the second case, "some" refers to a subset of
;; the set of books defined by "the books": that set cannot refer to the 
;; universal set of all existing books. The relation "part_of_rel" tries to
;; capture that notion of subset of a certain set (defined by the context, or 
;; the determiner of the NP complement): the subset has an index 
;; (ARG0), and the defined set is referred to by "SET", which is the handle of
;; the prepositional phrase, and also the handle of the determiner of the 
;; prepositional complement.  We thus give partitives a complex lexical
;; semantics, including both the part_of_rel and the original quantifier
;; relation, with its usual attributes.

;; A problem which remains is to get the right agreement with the right head.
;; At the moment, the index of the head is the same as the index of the 
;; original determiner. As an example, "all" can be mass or plural, and is 
;; going to agree with a singular or a plural verb, whatever its complement is
;; ("all of the cake", "all of the students"). If we decide to have the index
;; of the construction being the index of the complement noun, what about 
;; "each" ? "Each of the boys" will agree with a plural only, when it should
;; agree with a singular. On the other hand, there is also the problem of 
;; "all of the oats are", plural when "all" is the mass determiner here: 
;; agreement is determined, here, by the plural form of the complement noun.

;; Punctuation rules

; Making mother be SYNSEM lex_punct_synsem prevents spurious application of
; derivational rules that are constrained by synsem type.  Assumes that
; right punctuation will attempt to attach to each derivational stage of
; a lexical entry - maybe not pretty, but can't be helped since PUNCT has
; to be inside SYNSEM, so can't identify synsems of hd-dtr and mother.
