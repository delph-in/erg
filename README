10-Sept-99 Release Notes
-----------------------

Principal changes include:

1) Improvements in semantics on Verbmobil CD data (CDs 6, 31, 32)
2) Addition of lexical entries to support newer Verbmobil domain
3) Additional coverage for limited appositives (temporal only) and limited
   comparatives (adjectival only), as well as for a variety of minor extensions
   motivated by the CD data.

Installing the grammar
----------------------

To install a fresh copy of the grammar, use the cvs utility as follows:
1. Make sure you don't have a directory named "grammar" in your home
   directory (if you do, move it to another name):

	mkdir ~/grammar

2. Copy over the new files, which will cause a new directory called "grammar"
   to be created: 

	cvs checkout grammar

Batch processing and test suites
--------------------------------

To batch-process a set of sentences, you can use the integrated [incr tsdb()]
facility under active development at the Computational Linguistics department
at Saarland University:

  0) Chances are [incr tsdb()] is already included in your local LKB or PAGE
     installation (presumably CSLI and DFKI only); if not, consult

       http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/itsdb/

     for information on how to obtain and install the [incr tsdb()] package.

  1) To start up the [incr tsdb()] graphical interface, execute the Lisp
     command
 
       (load-system "tsdb")

     Instructions on how to use this utility are currently in preparation, 
     but in the meantime experiment.

  2) To pretty-print VIT results and check for well-formedness, do the query
     (assuming the variable tsdb::*tsdb-home* is set appropriately):

       (mrs::expand-tsdb-results "lingo/oct98/evm/98-11-08/page" "/tmp/vout" t)

     where the last argument determines whether or not the VIT checker is run.
     (This function is commented out in the file `mrsfns.lisp')

Web access
----------

A Web browser can let you parse sentences from any reasonable machine on the 
Internet and get back parse trees and MRS semantics.  If you are on a machine 
that also has the FeGramEd utility locally available, you can also get feature 
structures for parses, rule schemata, lexical rules, and lexical entries.  To
experiment with this interactive demo, go the Stanford HPSG Web page at

	http://hpsg.stanford.edu

and click on the "demonstration system" link found there.
