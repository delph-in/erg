Release notes for version "LinGO (30-Apr-05)"

This is a minor update to the Apr-05 version, including some lexical 
additions, adjustments to the semantic predicate hierarchy, and tuning
of syntactic analyses, all designed to improve end-to-end translation
for LOGON.  The only substantive difference is in the analysis of 
possessive constructions, where the grammar now produces nearly
identical MRSs for the two noun phrases "our book" and "a book of ours",
using a new lexical entry for "ours" distinct from the ordinary "ours"
of "ours are not ready".  One consequence of this reanalysis, which
unifies the treatment of the two possessive constructions, is that
the two arguments in the old 'poss_rel' EP have been reversed: what was 
the ARG1 is now ARG2, and vice versa.

Release notes for version "LinGO (Apr-05)"

Overview of changes:

 - Lexicon size increased to 21000 entries
 - MRS quality improved
 - Unicode now used for lexicon: foreign proper names, archaic spellings
 - Coverage added for fragments, locative inversion, 'free' parentheticals
 - Changed analyses to allow PP-modif of PPs, APs; adverb-modif of APs
 - Support for new domains: 'shanghai', 'gcide'

--Lexicon--

BNC - Based on months of hard labor by former Stanford students Hansook Lee
and Mike Orme (with help from Ara Kim), the lexicon now contains all verb
subcat entries for the 2000 most frequent verb stems in the British
National Corpus. This should enable some interesting experimentation in
automated lexical acquisition, since there are fewer lexical types that
need to be hypothesized for non-verbs.

GCIDE - The lexicon now also contains entries for all words observed in the
first 10,000 definition 'sentences' in the GNU Contemporary International
Dictionary of English (GCIDE), to enable more precise evaluation of
syntactic coverage of these definitions.

Shanghai - Based on some 1500 entries constructed by Yi Zhang at CoLI in
Saarbruecken, the lexicon now also contains entries for most of the words
found in a Web-derived corpus on tourism in Shanghai, analogous to the
Rondane corpus built by Becky Neil for the LOGON project in Norway.

--MRS quality--

Based on a substantial implementation effort by Stefan Thater and
colleagues at CoLi, Saarbruecken, to check for well-formedness of MRSs
produced by the grammar for the Redwoods and Rondane corpora, many errors
were identified, enabling improvements in MRS construction in the ERG.
Further improvements were enabled by the systematic use of existing
capabilities in the LKB for diagnosing MRS errors in ERG analyses.  While
the current release still produces some flawed MRSs for these data sets,
they are largely confined to a small inventory of known and somewhat
problematic minor phenomena.

--Unicode--

Drawing on the combined expertise of Stephan Oepen and Francis Bond, the
ERG is now fully Unicode-compliant, including the PSQL database.  This
enables proper representation in the lexicon for orthography of non-English
proper names such as "østerbø", and archaic English spellings such as
"coöperation".  The necessary infrastructure for Unicode is admirably and
demonstrably in place in the LKB, PET, [incr tsdb()], and PostgreSQL.

--Coverage--

Fragments - Further work on the treatment of fragments has been motivated
largely by the effort to parse the definition sentences in GCIDE, and to
give them a consistent semantic representation.  New fragment types now
licensed include VPs and PPs with NP gaps, as in "To devour." or
"Relying on.".

Locative inversion - The grammar now analyzes some locative inversion
phenomena, currently restricted to sentences headed by the finite copula
'be' as in "Near the park is a large dog" but not (yet) "Near the park
stood a large tree".  These appear with some frequency in the Rondane data,
and have also been waiting patiently for twenty years in the CSLI test
suite.

'Free' parentheticals - Sentences containing some classes of parenthetical
material (which would not survive in situ without the parentheses) will now
be analyzed, though further work will be needed in designing the target
semantics.  Example now covered: "That dog (you should see its owner!)
barked."

--Changed analyses--

Modification - Based on more systematic analysis of phenomena found in the
Rondane corpus, and corroborated in the Shanghai corpus, the ERG now
permits more interesting modification structures.  Prepositional phrases,
formerly restricted to modifying only VPs and nominal phrases, can now also
modify adjective phrase and other PPs.  Similarly, adverbs can now also
modify adjective phrases, as in "the wildly happy dog barked", freeing the
grammar from its former requirement that duplicate degree-specifier lexical
entries be added for many adverbs.

--New domains--

The GCIDE corpus has been taken from the GCIDE web site, and carefully
prepared by Eric Nichols at NTT in collaboration with Francis Bond,
including identification of sentence breaks, normalization, and formatting,
all of which are now automated via Perl scripts converting the original
GCIDE data into, among other things, an 'item' file format for use with the
fine system.

The Shanghai corpus is being collected by Yi Zhang in Saarbruecken as part
of his thesis work, and consists of text on tourism in Shanghai, written in
English and mostly but not entirely by native English speakers.  The corpus
may still be revised, so a profile of this data is not (yet) being
distributed with the ERG.
