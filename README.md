The [English Resource Grammar][] (ERG) is a general-purpose computational grammar that, in combination with specialized processing tools, can map running English text to highly normalized logical-form representations of meaning. A broad-coverage, linguistically precise HPSG-based grammar of English, the ERG is semantically grounded in [Minimal Recursion Semantics][] (MRS), which is a form of flat semantic representation capable of supporting underspecification. The ERG is developed as part of the international Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG Initiative (DELPH-IN) and can be processed by a number of parsing and realization systems, including the [LKB][] grammar engineering environment, as well as the [ACE][] and PET run-time parsers, for applications.  For documentation on DELPH-IN resources, see the [DELPH-IN documentation][].
