To avoid generating |B and C or D|, |B or C and D|:
  also avoid |it is (not) the case both that B and that C and/or D|
  also avoid |it is (not) the case either that B or that C and/or D|

In s-coord-top rule
  left conj is nonconj, and also not |it is (not) the case that...|
Want right conj to be either nonconj or marked as overt pair of either-or
  So s-coord-mid is only overt either-or.
Add paraphr rule to convert |B and C| to |it is the case both that B and that C|
(following suggested phrasing by Aaron), so we can still get output for |A&B&C|

---------
To do (2015-03-13)
+(1) Vertical bars in ORTH for letter names
+(2) Reduce or eliminate ambiguous outputs
(3) Larger set of `rule' names including syntactic variants (a+b => b+a)
(4) Pairing of rule+anchor to show where a (para) rule has applied in a sentence
    - assume single pivot per rule (at most)
(5) Reflexive pronouns (e.g. samesize; B is not between C and itself)

FOL => English paraphrases

To test web server on cypriot, check to see that the server is running
(~/start-op-server) and then open this form in a browser:
/home/danf/openproof/form.html
Enter an FOL expression such as tet(c)&tet(d) in the first box, and the name 
of a rules file in the second, where the filename is "rules.all" or 
"rules.pro": one of the preset rules files in ~/erg/openproof/rules.*".

The python server code is in ~/openproof, with the main file as Server/server.py

;; Test run: Compile a version of the paraphrase grammar, then call Aaron 
;; Kalb's FOL converter to MRS syntax, then inflate, add paraphrased MRSs, 
;; generate, sort uniquely, and package output as XML

;; Note: need ACE version 0919 (later ones don't work)
;; basque:/home/danf/logon/lingo/answer/bin/linux.x86.64/ace.0919

;; 2. To run single examples interactively, call `runfol' with at least the

;;
cd ~/erg/openproof; ./runfol -f "small(c)&small(b)" -r rules.agg > /tmp/out7-12.txt; more /tmp/out7-12.txt

;; 2b. Run example, and apply all rules in "rules.*" except those in "no.*"
;; (here, exclude "only if" and "provided (that)" in conditionals):
;; 
cd ~/erg/openproof; ./runfol -f "small(a)-->large(b)" -r rules.all -x no.onlyif+prov > /tmp/out.txt

;; 2c. Run example, and apply all rules in "rules.*" except those in "no.*", 
;; and add those in "req.*" (here, obligatorily omit "then" in conditionals):
