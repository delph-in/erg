If A is a tetrahedron then it is in front of D.
A is to the left of or right of D only if it's a cube.
C is between either A and E or A and D.
C is to the right of A, provided it (i.e., C) is small.
C is to the right of D only if B is to the right of C and left of E.
If E is a tetrahedron, then it's to the right of B if and only if it is also in front of B.
If B is a dodecahedron, then if it isn't in front of D then it isn't in back of D either.
C is in back of A but in front of E.
E is in front of D unless it (i.e., E) is a large tetrahedron.
At least one of A, C, and E is a cube.
A is a tetrahedron only if it is in front of B.
B is larger than both A and E.
A and E are both larger than C, but neither is large.
D is the same shape as B only if they are the same size.
A is large if and only if it's a cube.
B is a cube unless C is a tetrahedron.
If E isn't a cube, either B or D is large.
B or D is a cube if either A or C is a tetrahedron.
A is large just in case D is small.
A is large just in case E is.
