A is a cube.
B is smaller than A.
C is between A and D.
D is large.
E is larger than A.
B is a tetrahedron.
E is a dodecahedron.
E is right of B.
E is to the right of B.
A is smaller than E.
D is in back of A.
B is in the same row as D.
B is the same size as C.
F is not in front of A.
F is to the right of A and to the left of B.
F is either in back of or smaller than A.
E and D are between C and A.
Neither E nor D is larger than C.
E is neither larger than nor smaller than D.
C is smaller than A but larger than E.
C is in front of F; moreover, it is smaller than F.
B is in the same row as A but is not in the same column as F.
E is not in the same column as either C or D.
Either A is small or both C and D are large.
D and E are both in back of B.
D and E are both in back of B and larger than it.
Both D and C are cubes; however neither of them is small.
Neither E nor A is to the right of C and to the left of B.
Either E is not large or it is in back of A.
C is neither between A and B, nor in front of either of them.
Either both A and E are tetrahedra or both A and F are.
Neither D nor C is in front of either C or B.
C is either between D and F or smaller than both of them.
It is not the case that B is in the same row as C.
B is in the same column as E, which is in the same row as D, which in turn is in the same column as A.
If C is a tetrahedron, then A is not a tetrahedron.
If B is a tetrahedron, then D isn't.
If B is a tetrahedron, then C isn't.
If A is a cube and B is a dodecahedron, then A is to the left of B.
If B and C are both cubes, then they are in the same row but not in the same column.
B is a tetrahedron only if it is small.
If A and D are both cubes, then one is to the left of the other.
D is a cube if and only if it is either medium or large.
If B is neither to the right nor left of D, then one of them is a tetrahedron.
B and C are the same size if and only if one is a tetrahedron and the other is a dodecahedron.
If A is a tetrahedron then it is in front of D.
A is to the left of or right of D only if it's a cube.
C is between either A and E or A and D.
C is to the right of A, provided it (i.e., C) is small.
C is to the right of D only if B is to the right of C and left of E.
If E is a tetrahedron, then it's to the right of B if and only if it is also in front of B.
If B is a dodecahedron, then if it isn't in front of D then it isn't in back of D either.
C is in back of A but in front of E.
E is in front of D unless it (i.e., E) is a large tetrahedron.
At least one of A, C, and E is a cube.
A is a tetrahedron only if it is in front of B.
B is larger than both A and E.
A and E are both larger than C, but neither is large.
D is the same shape as B only if they are the same size.
A is large if and only if it's a cube.
B is a cube unless C is a tetrahedron.
If E isn't a cube, either B or D is large.
B or D is a cube if either A or C is a tetrahedron.
A is large just in case D is small.
A is large just in case E is.
If A is a tetrahedron, then B is also a tetrahedron.
C is a tetrahedron if B is.
A and C are both tetrahedra only if at least one of them is large.
A is a tetrahedron but C isn't large.
If C is small and D is a dodecahedron, then D is neither large nor small.
C is medium only if none of D, E, and F are cubes.
D is a small dodecahedron unless A is small.
E is large just in case it is a fact that D is large if and only if F is.
D and E are the same size.
D and E are the same shape.
F is either a cube or a dodecahedron, if it is large.
C is larger than E only if B is larger than C.
