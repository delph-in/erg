81211790@@@@1@@As I wrote last week, the WFP had warned that it would have to cut back on food aid to 1.2 million children in Syria if it did not receive the aid.@@@@1@32@@@

81245380@@@@1@@And Goldman wrote it in the wake of a breakup, and I think that’s why the story resonates with people:@@@@1@20@@@
81245390@@@@1@@It’s a story about heartbreak and finding love in the most unlikely of places.@@@@1@14@@@
81245400@@@@1@@I’ll admit it.@@@@1@3@@@
81245410@@@@1@@I’m not a huge fan of Hallmark movies.@@@@1@8@@@

81247770@@@@1@@That’s what makes “The Crime is Mine,” the 1991 Italian film by director Dino Risi, so engaging.@@@@1@17@@@
81247780@@@@1@@In a way, this is a crime movie, but it is also a film about the legal system, which is why the camera stays on the actors.@@@@1@27@@@

81262590@@@@1@@They have four games left against NFC North teams, and they have only one more game against a non-division opponent.@@@@1@20@@@
81262600@@@@1@@If they want to make the playoffs, they have to win at least one of those games, and preferably two of them.@@@@1@22@@@

81262710@@@@1@@But, they are only 1.5 games behind the division-leading Broncos and 1.5 games behind the division-leading Chiefs.@@@@1@17@@@

81262790@@@@1@@The Saints now have a 4-4 record and are in last place in the NFC South.@@@@1@16@@@
81262800@@@@1@@They are 2 games behind the Falcons and Panthers, and 1 game behind the Buccaneers.@@@@1@15@@@
81262810@@@@1@@The Dolphins have a tough stretch of games coming up.@@@@1@10@@@
81262820@@@@1@@They play the Broncos, the Saints, the Patriots and the Bills in the next four weeks.@@@@1@16@@@
81262830@@@@1@@The Dolphins will be favored in only one of those games (the Saints).@@@@1@13@@@

81262860@@@@1@@They have had opportunities.@@@@1@4@@@
81262870@@@@1@@They have had chances to prove that they are still a good football team.@@@@1@14@@@
81262880@@@@1@@The Buccaneers now sit at 3-4, after defeating the Redskins 19-16 on Sunday.@@@@1@13@@@
81262890@@@@1@@The Bucs are currently in 9th place in the NFC and hold a 1 game lead over the 10th place Panthers, who they face in Week 9.@@@@1@27@@@
81262900@@@@1@@The Bucs are in good position to make the playoffs, as they have a relatively easy schedule remaining.@@@@1@18@@@
81262910@@@@1@@Here's how they can do it.@@@@1@6@@@
81262920@@@@1@@The Seahawks now have to win 4 of their next 6 games.@@@@1@12@@@
81262930@@@@1@@The 49ers now have a record of 3-4 and are tied with the Arizona Cardinals for the 9th seed in the NFC.@@@@1@22@@@

81262960@@@@1@@The Steelers now find themselves in a 3-way tie for first place in the AFC North, with a 2-2 record.@@@@1@20@@@
81262970@@@@1@@With that said, the Steelers are not only in first place in the AFC North, but they are also tied for first place in the AFC as a whole, with a 4-2 record.@@@@1@33@@@
81262980@@@@1@@That said, they are in a good position right now.@@@@1@10@@@
81262990@@@@1@@The Titans now have two weeks to get back on track.@@@@1@11@@@
81263000@@@@1@@They will play at home against the Jaguars and then at San Diego, before going on a bye.@@@@1@18@@@
81263010@@@@1@@If they can get to 4-4 at that point, they will be right in the thick of things.@@@@1@18@@@
81263020@@@@1@@The Commanders now sit at 2-5 and are just 1.5 games out of a Wild Card spot.@@@@1@17@@@
81263030@@@@1@@They have an incredibly easy schedule the rest of the way and with a few breaks, they could end up 10-6 and right in the thick of the Wild Card race.@@@@1@31@@@
