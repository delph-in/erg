21490012@unknown@formal@none@1@S@One analyst, who asked not to be identified, said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid "in the $225 area," but that it could take three to four months to close.@@@@1@37@@oe@2-2-2013
21490013@unknown@formal@none@1@S@At that level, and given the uncertainty, he believes UAL stock should trade closer to@@@@1@15@@oe@2-2-2013
21490014@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Other observers note that UAL's board, having accepted a bid of $300 a share, might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal.@@@@1@50@@oe@2-2-2013
21490015@unknown@formal@none@1@S@By that logic, the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months, even though the eventual price might be higher.@@@@1@26@@oe@2-2-2013
21490016@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years, and aren't likely to stop, having come so close to success.@@@@1@38@@oe@2-2-2013
21490017@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.@@@@1@27@@oe@2-2-2013
21490018@unknown@formal@none@1@S@On Friday, they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them.@@@@1@12@@oe@2-2-2013
21490019@unknown@formal@none@1@S@However, investment bankers say that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July.@@@@1@60@@oe@2-2-2013
21490020@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk, that is, subordinate to the bank debt in any deal.@@@@1@21@@oe@2-2-2013
21490021@unknown@formal@none@1@S@That way, they figure, someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work, because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs.@@@@1@32@@oe@2-2-2013
21490022@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader.@@@@1@30@@oe@2-2-2013
21490023@unknown@formal@none@1@S@That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone.@@@@1@32@@oe@2-2-2013
21490024@unknown@formal@none@1@S@One obstacle to the pilots' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership.@@@@1@18@@oe@2-2-2013
21490025@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they, not the pilots, must have control.@@@@1@24@@oe@2-2-2013
21490026@unknown@formal@none@1@S@One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders.@@@@1@27@@oe@2-2-2013
21490027@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions, using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking.@@@@1@30@@oe@2-2-2013
