21365007@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.@@@@1@13@@oe@2-2-2013
21365008@unknown@formal@none@1@S@They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged.@@@@1@20@@oe@2-2-2013
21365009@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense, Mr. Runkel said.@@@@1@35@@oe@2-2-2013
21365010@unknown@formal@none@1@S@"That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt to seize the whole business; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime," he explained.@@@@1@32@@oe@2-2-2013
21365011@unknown@formal@none@1@S@In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction, Mr. Runkel said.@@@@1@40@@oe@2-2-2013
21366001@unknown@formal@none@1@S@It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress, let alone within the same party.@@@@1@17@@oe@2-2-2013
21366002@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez.@@@@1@26@@oe@2-2-2013
21366003@unknown@formal@none@1@S@It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.@@@@1@24@@oe@2-2-2013
21366004@unknown@formal@none@1@S@But instead of thanks, Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality.@@@@1@11@@oe@2-2-2013

21366006@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate, where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor, Charles Keating Jr., principal stockholder of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz.@@@@1@55@@oe@2-2-2013
21366007@unknown@formal@none@1@S@At the first day of the House Banking Committee's hearings last week, William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts, said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions.@@@@1@39@@oe@2-2-2013
21366008@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.@@@@1@24@@oe@2-2-2013
21366009@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to "subvert" the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating.@@@@1@28@@oe@2-2-2013
21366010@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Unlike many lawmakers, Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper.@@@@1@14@@oe@2-2-2013

21366014@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties.@@@@1@13@@oe@2-2-2013
21366015@unknown@formal@none@1@S@In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal, for example, Rep.

21366018@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open.@@@@1@24@@oe@2-2-2013
21366019@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Early in his political career, as a city councilman in San Antonio, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced, denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a "bat-roost meeting."@@@@1@37@@oe@2-2-2013
21366020@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.@@@@1@17@@oe@2-2-2013
21366021@unknown@formal@none@1@S@As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly.@@@@1@39@@oe@2-2-2013
