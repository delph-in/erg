20732002@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a "temporary" reduction when it is not?@@@@1@16@@oe@2-2-2013
20732003@unknown@formal@none@1@S@I think the reason is that you are confusing tax "rates" with tax "payments."@@@@1@14@@oe@2-2-2013
20732004@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example.@@@@1@14@@oe@2-2-2013
20732005@unknown@formal@none@1@S@You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only.@@@@1@16@@oe@2-2-2013
20732006@unknown@formal@none@1@S@You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation, which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate.@@@@1@19@@oe@2-2-2013
20732007@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain.@@@@1@30@@oe@2-2-2013
20732008@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation.@@@@1@26@@oe@2-2-2013
20732009@unknown@formal@none@1@S@But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law, even though the tax "rate" is the same under both systems.@@@@1@37@@oe@2-2-2013
