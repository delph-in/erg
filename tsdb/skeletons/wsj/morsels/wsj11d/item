21184021@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Subsequent meetings, initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts, were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information, according to GE.@@@@1@36@@oe@2-2-2013
