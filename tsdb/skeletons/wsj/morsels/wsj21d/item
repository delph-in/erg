22172009@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Together, the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders, and caused a 7.3% drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.@@@@1@33@@oe@2-2-2013
22172010@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Some said Friday's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal.@@@@1@30@@oe@2-2-2013

22172018@unknown@formal@none@1@S@AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both.@@@@1@34@@oe@2-2-2013
22172019@unknown@formal@none@1@S@AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs.@@@@1@28@@oe@2-2-2013

22172021@unknown@formal@none@1@S@"I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction, and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday," Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress.@@@@1@40@@oe@2-2-2013
