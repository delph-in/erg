20961001@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession, but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply.@@@@1@36@@oe@2-2-2013
20961002@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years.@@@@1@32@@oe@2-2-2013
