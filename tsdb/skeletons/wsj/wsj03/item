20376006@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders.@@@@1@17@@oe@2-2-2013
20376007@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.@@@@1@40@@oe@2-2-2013
