21797011@unknown@formal@none@1@S@"But it still hasn't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri, where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it's been an emotional issue for a long time."@@@@1@35@@oe@2-2-2013
21797012@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania, where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature doesn't reflect the viewpoints of the state's citizens.@@@@1@47@@oe@2-2-2013
21797013@unknown@formal@none@1@S@As a result, GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County, the legislature's leading foe of abortion, has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and, he hopes, to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place.@@@@1@60@@oe@2-2-2013
21797014@unknown@formal@none@1@S@The Freind legislation -- the state's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except to avert the death of the mother.@@@@1@49@@oe@2-2-2013
21797015@unknown@formal@none@1@S@Mr. Freind calculates that the provision, which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established, will "make it necessary" for the Supreme Court to review Roe and, perhaps, to overturn it.@@@@1@30@@oe@2-2-2013
21797016@unknown@formal@none@1@S@But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an "informed consent" provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves.@@@@1@35@@oe@2-2-2013
