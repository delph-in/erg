This directory contains the Semantic Interface (SEM-I) for the semantic ouputs
of the English Resource Grammar (ERG), called English Resource Semantics (ERS).
ERSs are couched in the framework of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS), which
provides a designer language for meaning representation in logical forms with
scope underspecification.  The SEM-I provides a semantic dictionary, spelling
out valid predicates in ERSs, the range of associated role identifiers, as well
as hierarchical relations (enabling sense underspecification) among predicates.

For more information on these files, please see:

General background on ERSs is available from the following links:

In addition to the SEM-I, this directory provides a quantitative summary of the
various segments of the LinGO Redwoods Treebank, in the file ‘redwoods.xls’.
Further background on the organization of the treebanks is available on-line:
