This interface provides on-line access to the 
<a href="http://www.delph-in.net/erg.html">LinGO English Resource Grammar</a>
(ERG).
Using facilities of the (a)
<a href="http://www.delph-in.net/lkb">Linguistic Knowledge 
Builder</a> (LKB) grammar 
engineering platform, (b) high-efficiency 
<a href="http://www.delph-in.net/pet/">PET System</a> parser, 
(c) <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb/">[incr&nbsp;tsdb()] profiling 
environment</a>, and (d) <a href="http://redwoods.stanford.edu">Redwoods
treebanking</a> tools, the interface allows one to input one 
sentence at a time, analyze it using the ERG, and visualize analysis 
results in various forms.

<p>
This on-line version, for the time being, only has access to the hand-built ERG
lexicon (of some thirty thousand lexemes, mostly taken from the scheduling,
e-commerce, financial services, and tourism domains).
Please be prepared to accomodate some vocabulary restrictions.  
The familiar androgynes Kim and Sandy or the old HP crew (Abrams, Browne,
Chiang, and Devito) are your best guess for proper names.  
Clicking the <i>Sample</i> button will activate a random 
selection from the CSLI syntactic test suite.
</p>
<p>
The LOGON on-line pages make relatively heavy use of Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) and (some) JavaScript; while it should be possible to navigate without
JavaScript, for the CSS to work properly, you will need a modern, HTML 4.0.1
compliant browser (e.g. FireFox or Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 7.x, IE 5.x, and 
later versions or derivatives).
Please relay bug reports and suggestions for improvement back to the ERG and
DELPH-IN developers.
